Python GUI Toolkits
====================

The GUI toolkits below are the main ones available. They all work for cross-platform development on all major platforms.

* [Qt](http://www.qt.io/)
    
    Qt is one of the major GUI toolkits around and is highly recommended. It's provided under GPL, LGPL and commercial. It has 2 main Python wrappers:

    - [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/): 
        
        It's a GPL wrapping of Qt which offers a commercial license.
        
    - [PySide](https://pyside.org/)
    
        PySide is a LGPL wrapping of Qt originally created by Nokia and currently supported by its community. Usually lags in support compared to PyQt (but doesn't require a commercial license for those that can abide to LGPL terms).


* [wxWidgets](http://wxwidgets.org/)

    wxWidgets is wrapped through [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/), which also provides a stable platform for GUI development.
        
* [Tcl/Tk](http://www.tcl.tk/)

    Python provides integration with Tcl/Tk through [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter). It's major point is that it's integrated and distributed along Python itself.
    

* [Kivy](http://kivy.org/)

    Kivy is an OpenGL-based platform for creating UIs, a strong point is its focus on multi-touch UIs.
